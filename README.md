# Multimodal Analysis of Music
## 1. Overview

The presence of gender stereotypes in many aspects of society is a well-known phenomenon. In this project, we have tried to quantify the existence of gender bias which exists in the music industry by analyzing lyrics and music videos. We also worked on the problem of detecting which genre a particular song belongs to just by analyzing the audio. Lastly, we also built a generative model to generate lyrics for songs for different genres. This generative approach helped us confirm our hypothesis that some genres of music are more biased and discriminating towards women as compared to others.

## 2. Dataset

For our multimodal analysis, we have analyzed all the 3 components of the music industry - lyrics of songs, music videos, audio of songs. Below is a brief description of each dataset:
- Lyrics: Downloaded 380,000 lyrics from Metrolyrics (Kaggle) Dataset (98 MB)
- Music Videos: Downloaded 1000 Music Videos from YouTube7(15GB)
- Audio: Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset (7.2 GB)

## 3. Directory
The repository contains 4 different folders corresponding to the four different components of our project:
- ``audio-classification`` 
- ``lyric-analysis``
- ``lyric-generation``
- ``video-analysis``
